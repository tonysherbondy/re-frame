;; -- Interceptors --------------------------------------------------------------
;; Interceptors are an advanced topic. So, we're plunging into the deep end here.
;;
;; There are full tutorials on Interceptors in re-frame's /docs. But to get
;; you going, here's a very high level description of them ...
;;
;; Every event handler can be "wrapped" in a chain of interceptors. Each of these
;; interceptors can do things "before" and/or "after" the event handler is executed.
;; They are like the "middleware" of web servers, wrapping around the "handler".
;; Interceptors are a useful way of factoring out commonality (across event
;; handlers) and looking after cross-cutting concerns like logging or validation.
;;
;; They are also used to "inject" values into the `coeffects` parameter of
;; an event handler, when that handler needs access to certain resources.
;;

(defn check-and-throw
  "Throws an exception if `db` doesn't match the Spec `a-spec`."
  [a-spec db]
  (when-not (s/valid? a-spec db)
    (throw (ex-info (str "spec check failed: " (s/explain-str a-spec db)) {}))))

;; Event handlers change state, that's their job. But what happens if there's
;; a bug in the event handler and it corrupts application state in some subtle way?
;; Next, we create an interceptor called `check-spec-interceptor`.
;; Later, we use this interceptor in the interceptor chain of all event handlers.
;; When included in the interceptor chain of an event handler, this interceptor
;; runs `check-and-throw` `after` the event handler has finished, checking
;; the value for `app-db` against a spec.
;; If the event handler corrupted the value for `app-db` an exception will be
;; thrown. This helps us detect event handler bugs early.
;; Because all state is held in `app-db`, we are effectively validating the
;; ENTIRE state of the application after each event handler runs.  All of it.
(def check-spec-interceptor (after (partial check-and-throw :todomvc.db/db)))

;; Part of the TodoMVC challenge is to store todos in local storage.
;; Next, we define an interceptor to help with this challenge.
;; This interceptor runs `after` an event handler, and it stores the
;; current todos into local storage.
;; Later, we include this interceptor into the interceptor chain
;; of all event handlers which modify todos.  In this way, we ensure that
;; any change to todos is written to local storage.
(def ->local-store (after todos->local-store))

;; Each event handler can have its own chain of interceptors.
;; Below we create the interceptor chain shared by all event handlers
;; which manipulate todos.
;; A chain of interceptors is a vector.
;; Explanation of `path` and `trim-v` is given further below.

;;   2. Default initial values
;;
;; Advanced topic:  we inject the todos currently stored in LocalStore
;; into the first, coeffect parameter via use of the interceptor
;;    `(inject-cofx :local-store-todos)`
;;
;; To fully understand this advanced topic, you'll have to read the tutorials
;; and look at the bottom of `db.cljs` for the `:local-store-todos` cofx
;; registration.

  ;; The event handler function.
  ;; The "path" interceptor in `todo-interceptors` means 1st parameter is the

  ;; And, further, it means the event handler returns just the value to be
  ;; put into `:todos` path, and not the entire `db`.
  ;; So, a path interceptor makes the event handler act more like clojure's `update-in`
